## Usage
`/ai <TASK_DESCRIPTION | list | info <role> | workflow | auto>`

## 🎯 Task Complexity Assessment

### Level 1: Simple Tasks - Handle directly
- Single file modification (<50 lines)
- Basic information queries
- Simple configuration changes
- Basic file operations

### Level 2: Medium Tasks - Single specialized agent
- Multi-file modifications with clear logic
- Specific domain knowledge required
- Single technology stack focus
- Feature implementation or bug fixes

### Level 3: Complex Tasks - Multi-agent collaboration
- Cross-system architecture changes
- Multiple professional domains needed
- Multi-module/service impact
- Complete planning and implementation required

**Action**: Use task-dispatch-planner to create execution plan, then main Claude Code executes agents sequentially

## ⚡ Auto-Trigger Conditions
Call agents automatically when:
1. **Technology stack mentioned**: "Vue project", "React app", "Go microservices", "Android development"
2. **Complex features** requiring 3+ technology components
3. **Architecture requests**: "system design", "architecture refactoring", "microservice splitting"
4. **Security analysis**: "Xposed development", "Hook analysis", "malware detection"
5. **Performance optimization** requiring multi-layer analysis

## 🚫 Direct Handling
Handle without agents:
- File reading, searching, basic analysis
- Simple code modifications or config updates
- Information queries and technical explanations

## 🛡️ Anti-Over-Engineering Principles
- **One goal, one agent**: Only call one agent unless true collaboration needed
- **Minimum viable solution**: Choose simplest working method
- **User-oriented**: Based on explicit user needs, not assumptions
